## 🧭 Introduction

This repository contains six practical laboratory projects focused on cryptographic algorithms, security protocols, and cryptanalysis techniques. Each lab explores fundamental concepts in modern cryptography, ranging from classical ciphers to advanced public key systems and digital signatures. The implementations provide hands-on experience with encryption, decryption, and security analysis using Python.

## ✅ Conclusion

Through this comprehensive lab series, I am developing expertise in both theoretical and practical aspects of cryptography and information security. The completed laboratories cover:

- **Lab 1-2**: Classical cryptography foundations - Caesar cipher implementation and frequency-based cryptanalysis
- **Lab 3**: Polyalphabetic substitution with Playfair cipher, featuring multi-alphabet support and clean OOP architecture
- **Lab 4**: Modern symmetric cryptography fundamentals through DES key schedule algorithm and permutation operations
- **Lab 5**: Asymmetric cryptography - RSA encryption/decryption (2048-bit), ElGamal probabilistic encryption, and Diffie-Hellman key exchange with AES-256 key derivation
- **Lab 6**: Digital signatures and hash functions - RSA signatures (3072-bit, MD5), ElGamal signatures (2048-bit, MD4), demonstrating message authentication and non-repudiation

The journey progresses from historical ciphers through modern symmetric encryption to public-key cryptography and digital signatures. These projects strengthen understanding of security principles while building practical skills in implementing and analyzing cryptographic systems using Python.
